      "Results: Two (0.08%) JSOG members had contracted COVID-19. There was a clear decrease in the number of patients scheduled for operation, not only for malignant but also for benign diseases. A decrease in the number of outpatients for infertility treatment was also observed. Polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was available in 20.4% of the facilities. Inpatients and outpatients were requested to wear masks, limit the number of contacts and check body temperature when visiting hospitals/clinics. During parturition care, caregivers and physicians wore gloves, masks (other than N-95), face shields and gowns. About 66% and 80% of the facilities decided to transfer pregnant women if they had asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, respectively. Cesarean section was typically chosen as delivery mode in infected women.\n",

      "Results: During the study period, 21 subjects with LOD suspected of being secondary to a genetic variant of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were referred for analysis. Of these, 17 fetuses had brain overgrowth, including six with isolated megalencephaly (MEG) and 11 with hemimegalencephaly (HMEG). Of the six with MEG, germline variants were identified in four cases, in either PIK3R2, AKT3 or MTOR, and a postzygotic PIK3R2 variant was found in the other two cases. Of the 11 with HMEG, a postzygotic PIK3CA variant was found in three fetuses with extracerebral features of PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum, and in seven fetuses with isolated HMEG. No pathogenic variant was identified in the 11<sup>th</sup> case with HMEG. Four fetuses with limb overgrowth also had one or more lymphatic malformations (LM) and harbored a postzygotic PIK3CA variant. NGS on cultured amniocytes performed in 10 cases, of which nine had been found positive on analysis of pathological fetal tissue, showed variants in four, in either PIK3CA, PIK3R2 or AKT3.\n",

      "Results: We found a low expression of PCDH8 in OC tissues versus the corresponding adjacent tissue. The PCDH8 expression, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, metastasis and recurrence were the independent prognostic factors for over-all survival by multivariate analyses. Furthermore, the patients with recurrence presented a low level of PCDH8 in OC tissues, and patients with advanced tumor stage also had a low PCDH8 expression. Importantly, the low expression of PCDH8 in OC tissues had a poor prognosis with a low overall survival rate. Overexpression of PCDH8 could inhibit OC cell growth/proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation in vitro. In vivo experiments also proved that overexpression of PCDH8 could inhibit OC cell growth/proliferation.\n",

      "Results: Questionnaires from 180 gynecologists were analyzed, of whom 61 were working office-based in private practice and 95 were employed in hospitals. Seventy percent stated that IM concepts are implemented in their routine clinical work. Most physicians reported using IM methods in gynecological oncology. The main indications for IM therapies were fatigue (n = 98), nausea and vomiting (n = 89), climacteric symptoms (n = 87), and sleep disturbances (n = 86). The most commonly recommended methods were exercise therapy (n = 86), mistletoe therapy (n = 78), and phytotherapy (n = 74). Gynecologists offering IM were more often female (P = 0.001), more often had qualifications in anthroposophic medicine (P = 0.005) or naturopathy (P = 0.019), and were more often based in large cities (P = 0.016).\n",

At a laparoscopic score ≥ 10, the possibility of optimal cytoreduction was 0, and the risk of unnecessary explorative attempts was 6%. Additionally, laparoscopic score, independent of residual tumor size and FIGO stage, was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in EOC. Notably, the predictive nomogram that we established further confirmed the prognostic value of laparoscopy for prognostic predictions in EOC.\n",

      "Title: Impact of body mass index, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, physical activity and parity on disease course of women with triple-negative breast cancer.\n",
      "Results: A total of 197 patients were analyzed. More than 50% of women were 40-60 years old (mean 57 years) and had a normal BMI. More than 88% of patients had either a T1 or T2 tumor, 64% were N0 and 66.5% had a G3 cancer. Thirty-four of 84 patients (40.38%) on neo-adjuvant chemotherapy reached a pathology-confirmed complete remission. During the follow-up (median 41.43 months), 34 (17.3%) patients had recurrent disease and 51 (25.9%) suffered from metastases. A total of 51 (25.9%) finally deceased. OS and DFS were not significantly impacted by BMI (OS: p = 0.4720; DFS: p = 0.2272), smoking habit (p = 0.9892; p = 0.6040), alcohol consumption (p = 0.6515; p = 0.7460), physical activity (p = 0.3320; p = 0.5991) or parity (p = 0.5929; 0.1417).\n",

      "Title: FIGO 2018 stage IB endocervical adenocarcinomas: an international study of outcomes informed by prognostic biomarkers.\n",
      "Results: Of 464 cases, 225 (48%) were stage IB1, 177 (38%) were stage IB2, and 62 (13%) were stage IB3. Five-year and 10-year recurrence-free survivals were statistically different among stage IB sub-types (p=0.005). Silva pattern of invasion was significant for recurrence-free survival at 5 and 10 years (p=0.04); overall survival and recurrence-free survival were higher in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cases (p=0.007 and p=0.001, respectively) and in cases without lymphovascular invasion (p=0.004 and p=0.00001, respectively). Factors that significantly influenced recurrence-free survival were HPV-independent status (p=0.05; HR 2.31; 95% CI 1.02 to 5.46), presence of lymphovascular invasion (p=0.011; HR 3.50; 95% CI 1.33 to 9.19), and presence of lymph node metastasis (p=0.016; HR 2.66; 95% CI 1.20 to 5.90).\n",

      "Title: Perinatal and infant outcome of fetuses with prenatally diagnosed hyperechogenic kidneys.\n",
      "Results: Three-hundred and sixteen fetuses with hyperechogenic kidneys were identified at a mean gestational age of 21 (range, 13-37) weeks. The majority of cases (97%) had bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys. In the 265 cases with available follow-up data, other associated renal tract abnormalities were identified prenatally in 36%, concomitant extrarenal structural abnormalities in 39% and abnormal karyotype in 15% of cases. Of the 316 included cases, 139 did not survive, including 105 terminations of pregnancy, five intrauterine deaths and 29 early neonatal deaths. Only 4.3% (6/139) of these fetuses had isolated hyperechogenic kidneys while 28.1% (39/139) had associated multiple renal tract abnormalities alongside hyperechogenic kidneys and over two-thirds (67.6%; 94/139) had concomitant extrarenal abnormalities. Of the 177 cases that survived beyond 1 month of age, outcome data were available in 126. Of these, based on the antenatal findings, 60 (47.6%) cases had isolated hyperechogenic kidneys, 56 (44.4%) had associated renal structural abnormalities and 10 (7.9%) had additional extrarenal abnormalities. Considering renal outcome alone, kidney function was abnormal in 13 (21.7%), 10 (17.9%) and 0 (0%) infants in these three groups, respectively, although concurrent pathology clearly affected global outcome in the more complex cases. Neonatal mortality of 1.6% was observed in the isolated renal hyperechogenicity group. The presence of oligohydramnios or abnormal renal volume was not associated significantly with abnormal renal function (odds ratio (OR), 2.32 (99% CI, 0.54-10.02) and OR, 0.74 (99% CI, 0.21-2.59), respectively) in this group.\n",

      "Title: The tumor-stroma ratio is an independent predictor of survival in patients with 2018 FIGO stage IIIC squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix following primary radical surgery.\n",
      "Results: Sixty-seven patients were categorized as stroma-high; they had shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) periods than did their stroma-low counterparts. On multivariate analysis, a tumor size ≥4 cm, ≥3 metastatic lymph nodes, and stroma-high status were independent predictors of shorter DFS and OS. These factors were incorporated into a prognostic scoring system in which patients were categorized into low- (score 0), intermediate- (score 1), and high-risk (scores 2-3) groups. The scoring system differentiated DFS and OS well (C-index = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.72; and C-index = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.72, respectively).\n",
